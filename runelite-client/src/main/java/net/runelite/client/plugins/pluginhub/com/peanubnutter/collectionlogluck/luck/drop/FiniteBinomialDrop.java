// This is identical to BinomialDrop, but you can only receive the item X times.
// Dryness and luck are calculated as normal if the item has not been received (or is received less than X times),
// but once receiving the item the Xth time, the dryness becomes exactly 0 since we cannot know when exactly the player
// received the item, and there are 0 players that have received the item more times than X by this KC.
// The luck is always calculated as normal (defines as the fraction of players less lucky than you). This fraction
// tends towards 0 as KC increases, since fewer and fewer people go dry, so luck tends towards 0 and "overall luck"
// evens out towards 50% as everyone has all received their X maximum drops by infinite KC.
