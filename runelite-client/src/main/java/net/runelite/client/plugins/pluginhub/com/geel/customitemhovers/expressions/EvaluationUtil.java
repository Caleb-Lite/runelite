     * Statically evaluates a CompiledExpression, returning its simplified form.
     *
     * If the expression is fully statically evaluatable, the resultant `CompiledExpression` will contain only
     * a single Token, which is the result of evaluation.
     *
     *
     *
     * This will attempt to execute as much of the expression as possible, replacing constant operations (eg "3 + 4") with
     * their results.
     *
     * The end result will, ideally, be the simplest form of an expression possible, with all operations on constant values pre-resolved.
     *
     * For example, take the following expression: (3 + (4 - sqrt(sqrt(81))) - pow(2, 0) + (2 * a)
     *
     * This expression references a variable -- `a` -- which we will only be able to resolve at runtime, when we're hovering over an item.
     * However, it also contains many static math operations, including some functions -- `pow` and `sqrt`.
     *
     * Both functions called (`pow` and `sqrt`) are `constexpr` (meaning they can be evaluated without any game state),
     * and the arguments being fed into them are const themselves.
     *
     * sqrt(sqrt(81)) should simplify to sqrt(9) -> 3
     * pow(2,0) should simplify to 1
     *
     * Therefore, the entire above expression can be statically evaluated to:
     * (3 + (4 - 3)) - 1 + (2 * a) -> (4) - 1 + (2 * a) -> 3 + (2 * a)
     *
     * Which, in RPN form, would be: 2 a * 3 +
     *
     * That's a mere 5 tokens that we have to execute at runtime, instead of however many were in the original expression.
