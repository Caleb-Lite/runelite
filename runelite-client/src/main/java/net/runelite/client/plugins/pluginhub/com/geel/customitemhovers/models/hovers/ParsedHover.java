/**
 * A parsed Hover from a HoverFile.
 *
 * One ParsedHover is created for every 1D hover array in the 2D array of a HoverDef. That is, for every individual
 * hover box.
 *
 * This class exists as a caching mechanism for expressions; we want to parse (tokenize + shunting-yard) hover texts
 * as infrequently as possible (on load only).
 *
 * Therefore, `hoverText` contains a hoverbox text with all expressions removed.
 * `expressionLocations` is an ascending array of positions that expression results should be inserted,
 * and `expressions` is an array of expressions.
 *
 * To fully resolve `hoverText`, simply copy it, and then iterate through `expressionLocations` and `expressions`
 * simultaneously (their indexes align) -- evaluate each expression in turn, and insert the string result into
 * `hoverText` at the location indicated by `expressionLocations[i]`.
